  <h2>Real-time Monitoring</h2>
  <br />

  Monitor the statuses and real-time events of doors  under the access control panels in the system in real-time, including normal  events and exceptional events (including alarm events).
  <br /><br />

  <h3>Electro-Map</h3>
  <br />
Before using the electro-map, user needs to add the map to the system first. After success adding, user can add door, zoom-in, zoom-out the map (and the door on the map), etc. If the user changes the door icon, or the map, or the position of door icon, click [Save Position] to save the current position, then the user can view the setting at the next time access.<br /><br />
<b>Add Map and Delete Map:</b> User can add or delete the map as needed.<br />
<br />
<b>Edit Map: </b>User can change the map name, change map or change the area it belongs to.<br />
<br />
<b>Adjust map (includes door):</b> User can add a door on the map, or delete an exist one (right click the door icon, and select [Remove Door]), or adjust the map or position of the door icon (by drag the door icon), adjust the size of the map (click [Zoom in] or [Zoom out]). <br />
<br />
<b>Real-time door status monitoring:</b> Except to display the electro-map, the system can view the real-time event monitoring (same data source with door status monitoring, include alarm sound, etc.).<br />
<br />
<b>Door operation:</b> Move the mouse icon to the door position, the system will automatically filter the operation according to the door status and display them on the popup menu. User can remote open or close the door, cancel alarm, and etc.<br />
<br />
<b>User right control:</b> <br />
<br />
(1) In adding process, user needs to select the belonging area for map. The area set here is relevant to the user management rights, that is, the user can only view or manage the map under his rights. If the user modify the belonging area of a map, all door on that map will be cleared, and need to add again.<br />
<br />
(2) When the administrator add a new user, he can manage the user operation rights by role setting, such as the operation of [Save door position], [Zoom in], [Zoom out], etc.<br />
<br />
<ol><b>Note:</b> <br />
<br />
(1) In map modification, the user can select to modify the map name but not the path, only need to cancel the tick before [Modify Path].<br />
<br />

<br />
