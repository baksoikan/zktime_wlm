  <br />

    DST setting and click [OK] to confirm.</p><br />
  <p>Otherwise, in the [Access Control] - [Door Configuration] interface, select the device, and click [Enable daylight saving 
    time] or [Disable daylight saving time] for setting.</p><br />
  <p>If a DST setting is in use, the latest modification will be sent to the device. The device disconnect will lead to
    transmission failure, and it will continue the transmission at the next connection.</p><br />
  <p>In door management module of access control system, you can enable or disable DST function. If you enable DST 
    setting, when the start time arrives, the system will be one hour forward. When the end time arrives, the system will turn 
    back to the original time. If you have not set a DST in the device, when you disable DST, the system will prompt "The 
    daylight saving time hasn't been set in this device".</p><br />
  <p><b>Note: </b>If a DST setting is in use, it can not be delete, please first stop the DST, and delete it again.</p><br />
