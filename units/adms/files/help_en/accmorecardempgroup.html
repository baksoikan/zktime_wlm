  <h3>Multi-Card Opening  Personnel Groups</h3><br />
      This function needs to be enabled in some special access occasions, where the door will open only after consecutive card punching by several people. Before verifying, any card punching out of this combination (even the card belongs to other combination) will interrupt the procedure, and you need to wait 10 seconds to restart verifying. It will not open upon card punching by one of the combination.<br />
	  <br />
	    It is a personnel grouping. The group will be used for  the setting of Multi-Card Opening.<br /><br />
