  <h3>Anti-passback  settings</h3><br />
  Currently anti-passback settings support in and out  anti-passback. In some special occasions, it is required that the card holder  who entered from a door by card punching must exit from the same door by card  punching, with the entry and exit records strictly consistent. One who followed  another to enter the door without card punching will be denied when trying to  exit by card punching, and one who followed another to exit without card  punching will be denied when trying to enter by card punching. And when one who  entered by card punching gives the card to another to try entering, the other  person will be denied. The user can use this function just by enable it in the  settings. This function is normally used in prisons, the army, national  defense, scientific research, bank vaults, etc.<br />
      <br /><b>Add anti-passback settings:</b><br /><br />
    1. Click [Access Control] - [Door configurations] - [Anti-passback  settings] - [Add] to show anti-passback setting edit interface;<br /><br />

Select device (N-door control panel), because one  device can only correspond to one anti-passback setting record, so when adding,  devices with anti-passback settings cannot be seen in the dropdown list.

Anti-passback can be set between readers and between doors. The card holder enter from door A, he must exit from door B, this function is used for channel or ticket management.
